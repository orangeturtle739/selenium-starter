# Selenium Starter

1.  `cd` into a good directory. Run `git clone
    https://github.com/orangeturtle739/selenium-starter.git` and then `cd
    selenium-starter`.
2.  Configure your environment. If running [Nix](https://nixos.org/), run `nix
    develop`. You may use
    [direnv](https://zimbatm.com/NixFlakes/#direnv-integration) as well. On a
    Mac, it is probably easiest to `pip install selenium`. See
    <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#downloading-python-bindings-for-selenium>.
3.  Look at `main.py`. I included 2 links on top which explain how to get
    started.
4.  Run `python main.py` in a terminal to run your program.
